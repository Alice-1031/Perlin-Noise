Uses PerlinNoise module from the P5.js library to render particle simulation in real time, giving them smooth flowing movements. Particles change direction based on brightest pixel 
so turn on your web cam in a dark room and either use some type of flash light aimed at the camera or just move your hand around the fron of the camera.

To use simply run the sketch.js file. Play around with the number of particles and initial population positions.
